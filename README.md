## Introduction
This project focuses on visualizing the top ten countries most impacted by earthquakes from 2000 to 2020. Using QGIS, I analyzed seismic data to create insightful visualizations that highlight the global distribution and impact of earthquakes over the past two decades.

## Project Overview
The project involves processing earthquake data, filtering it to identify the most affected countries, and visualizing the results on a global map. The primary goal is to provide a clear, visual representation of how earthquakes have impacted different regions, helping to inform discussions on disaster preparedness and response.

Key features of this project include:
- Identification of the top ten countries most impacted by earthquakes.
- Visualization of earthquake occurrences and their intensity over a 20-year period.
- Use of QGIS tools for data analysis and mapping.

## Technologies
This project was built using the following technologies:
- **QGIS**: A free and open-source Geographic Information System used for spatial data analysis and mapping.
- **Seismic Data**: Earthquake data sourced from reputable global databases.
- **GeoJSON/CSV**: Data formats used for storing and processing geographic and attribute data.

## Setup
To replicate this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install QGIS**:
   - Download and install the latest version of QGIS from the [official website](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).

2. **Download Project Files**:
   - Clone this repository or download the project files directly.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/earthquake-visualization.git
